    *   **Encryption:** Sensitive data is protected through encryption, whether it's stored on our systems or being transmitted, using industry-standard methods.
    *   **Data Minimization:** We only collect and retain the data that's truly necessary for defined business purposes, reducing our risk exposure.
    *   **Backup & Recovery:** We regularly back up our data and have robust plans in place to recover it quickly and efficiently if something goes wrong.
    *   **Secure Disposal:** When data or media are no longer needed, we ensure they are disposed of securely and irreversibly.
