<small>Author: Olivier Sels | Company: Cylk | Updated: 22-05-2025 | Status: draft</small>

## 1. Introduction & Purpose

At Cylk, our digital security is a shared responsibility, just like our success. This policy outlines our approach to passwords and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), two fundamental pillars of our cybersecurity strategy. By working together to secure our digital identities, we protect company information, systems, and our collective reputation.

The purpose of this policy is to:
*   üõ°Ô∏è Establish clear guidelines for creating, managing, and protecting passwords.
*   üîê Mandate the use of MFA for critical systems to add an extra layer of security.
*   ü§ù Ensure a consistent and secure approach to digital access across Cylk.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to **all Cylk employees, contractors, temporary staff, and anyone with access to Cylk's information systems and data.**

It covers **all accounts used to access Cylk's systems and services**, including but not limited to:
*   Company-issued devices (laptops, phones).
*   Cloud applications (e.g., Office 365, Azure, Slack, Odoo).
*   Internal network resources.
*   Any system storing or processing company data.

## 3. Checklist

Here‚Äôs a quick summary of what we all need to do to keep Cylk safe:

*   **Use Strong Passwords**: Create unique, long, and complex passwords for all Cylk accounts.
*   **Enable MFA**: Always use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for critical systems.
*   **No Sharing**: Never share your passwords or MFA codes with anyone.
*   **Use a Password Manager**: Securely store and generate unique passwords using our approved password manager.
*   **Change Defaults**: Immediately change any default passwords on new systems or services.
*   **Individual Accounts**: Only use your individual Cylk accounts; no shared accounts.
*   **Report Concerns**: If you suspect an account is compromised, report it immediately.

## 4. Policy Requirement Details

### 4.1 Password Strength & Management

*   **Password Complexity & Length** üí™
    *   All passwords for Cylk systems and services must be at least **14 characters long**.
    *   They should include a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
    *   Do not use easily guessable information such as personal names, company names, or common dictionary words.
*   **Password Uniqueness & Reuse** üîÑ
    *   Each Cylk account must have a **unique password**. Do not reuse passwords across different Cylk systems or, crucially, for any personal accounts outside of Cylk.
*   **Password Storage & Sharing** ü§´
    *   Passwords must never be written down in plain sight, stored insecurely (e.g., in unencrypted files), or shared with anyone, for any reason.
    *   **Never share your password, even with IT personnel.** Cylk IT will never ask for your password.
*   **Password Manager Usage** üîë
    *   All employees are **required to use Cylk's approved password manager** for storing and generating secure passwords for all company-related accounts. This tool helps you create strong, unique passwords and access them securely.
*   **Default Passwords** üõ†Ô∏è
    *   Any default passwords provided with new hardware, software, or services must be **changed immediately** upon initial setup.

### 4.2 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

*   **MFA Requirement** üîê
    *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is mandatory for accessing all critical Cylk systems and services.** This includes, but is not limited to, Microsoft 365 (including Outlook, Teams, OneDrive), Azure, Odoo, and any other systems deemed critical by IT.
    *   MFA adds an essential layer of security by requiring a second form of verification (e.g., a code from your phone, a biometric scan) in addition to your password.
*   **MFA Protection** üõë
    *   Do not approve MFA requests unless you are actively attempting to log in. If you receive an MFA request you didn't initiate, deny it and report it to IT immediately.

### 4.3 Account Management

*   **Individual Accounts** üßç
    *   Access to Cylk systems must always be through **individual user accounts**. Shared accounts are strictly prohibited unless explicitly approved by IT for specific, audited purposes.
*   **Administrator Privileges** üë®‚Äçüíª
    *   Users should only have the minimum level of access necessary to perform their job duties (principle of least privilege).
    *   Regular user accounts should **not be used for daily work if they possess administrator privileges**. Dedicated administrator accounts should be used only when elevated privileges are required, and never for routine tasks like email or browsing.
*   **Account Disabling** üö´
    *   Upon an employee's departure or a contractor's project completion, their access to Cylk systems will be **immediately disabled** by the IT team.
    *   Unused or dormant accounts will be reviewed periodically and disabled or removed to minimize security risks.

## 5. Responsibilities

*   **All Cylk Employees & Contractors**:
    *   Adhere to all aspects of this policy.
    *   Create and maintain strong, unique passwords.
    *   Enable and use MFA as required.
    *   Report any suspected password compromise or unauthorized account activity immediately to the IT team.
*   **IT & Security Team**:
    *   Implement and maintain secure password and MFA configurations across Cylk systems.
    *   Provide guidance, tools (like the password manager), and support for policy adherence.
    *   Monitor for suspicious account activity and respond to security incidents.
    *   Regularly review and update this policy to reflect evolving best practices and threats.
*   **Management**:
    *   Ensure their teams understand and comply with this policy.
    *   Provide the necessary resources for policy implementation and adherence.

## 6. Policy Enforcement & Non-Compliance

Our collective commitment to this policy is vital for the security of Cylk. Everyone is expected to adhere to these guidelines to help keep our company safe from cyber threats.

Non-compliance with this policy may result in disciplinary action, as unauthorized access to company systems and data can have serious consequences for Cylk and its employees. Our goal is always to support and educate, but consistent disregard for security policies undermines our collective safety.
